# Automated Test Framework

This automated framework is a collection of automated test-scripts for a debian system, which can
be run on LAVA or Non-Lava environment


Each test-suite has a yaml based test definition file for LAVA environment.

To run a lava based test, boot your device in lava and submit the specific
test-suite definition file.
