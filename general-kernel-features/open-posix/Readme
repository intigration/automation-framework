The Open POSIX* Test Suite is an open source test suite with the goal of performing
conformance,functional,stress,and performance testing of the functions described
in the IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 System Interfaces specification.
Eventual testing of the full specification is desired.

Open-POSIX TestSuite source is available on ltp(linux test project) under /testcases/open_posix_testsuite

How to Compile and run test:
e.g:

i)Go to open_posix_testsuite directory.

#cd /opt/ltp/testcases/open_posix_testsuite/

ii)Generate generic POSIX compliant Makefiles.

#make generate-makefiles

iii)To just build conformance tests,run:

#make conformance-all

iv)To just runconformance tests,run:

#make conformance-test

Note:If you find "ERROR: ../../../bin/t0 doesn't exist / isn't executable"  error
while running the test,to resolve this just create t0 file under "/opt/ltp/testcases/open_posix_testsuite/bin" path.

e.g.
# touch t0

Test Number:

conformance test: 1717(aprox.)
Stress test     : 3
Functional test : 17
